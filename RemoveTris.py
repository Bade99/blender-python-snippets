#TODO(fran): clearly hypotenuse calculation aint good enough.
    #Alternative 1: make the triangle a right angle rectangle and then calculate. The problem is we dont know which side should be the right angle, what we could do is execute this path only for tris whose normal is very close to an axis, and then project onto that axis's plane, then it becomes obvious which angle should be the right one. Though this looks to be prone to inconsistencies based on the shape of the object (the obj would need to be very axis aligned, which may or may not be the case depending on the object, but we could let the user decide whether to use this analyzer or not).
    #Alternative 2: analyze the two potential rectangles and measure something in them that tells us which is the right one, eg. their uniformity, their angles. And then only take the X % more likely to be correct (eg 50 % likeliest by having the greatest proportional difference in angle/uniformity/etc) and modifiy them. Then repeat the entire process.
    #INFO: One piece of important data is that we can (almost) always know which side is the short end, and therefore we always know the vertex that needs to be "moved".
    # Alternative 3: We know that most of the topology is good and follows the right gradient, and then we usually have big patches (more than 2 wrong tris close) of wrong gradient, thus we could do a gradient analysis for both alternatives and take the one that more closely follows the 'accepted' gradient.
    #  In addition to this we probably want to attack first the smaller patches of tris, because those screwed up the surrounding topology less, and also to fix first the outer most triangles, best being the ones that have no face neighbor and thus only one valid alternative to be fixed
    # Alternative 4: Yet another, more extreme solution, would be to let it all play out in both variations (always 'up' vs always 'down' (based on the tri's orientation)) and see which one requires less face changes, and keep that one.
    # Alternative 5: Finally the best option would be to execute all analyzers, maybe also weigh them based on how accurate we think they are, and pick the alternative that the mayority chose. (aka we are making an AI, said AI would be happy to have some training data that's already solved to be able compare its progress/learning)
    # Alt 7: create a huge list of affected faces from all triangles (aka the two ones at the bottom and the top of the triangle), and then analyse the gradients of the unaffected faces that connect with the top and bottom face, and choose the good side at the one that more closely follows the unaffected gradient
        #NOTE IMPORTANT: actually the best way to recover the gradient would be by looking at the shape from the outside (looking at the contour, aka the edge vertices), taking into account sections of similar facing normals and then just take the vertices that mark the whole outisde of the shape. The directions of the faces that make up the shape should match the look of the shape.
    #Alt 8: [SUPER IMPORTANT] there's a very common formation that shows up, a strip of wrong faces between two triangles, usually not longer that 4 wrong faces long, we could try to find this strips and correct them in bulk first
    
        #THIS IS CRUCIAL: for a tri to be generated there must be another tri somewhere along its face loops that it has to connect to (on 99% of cases except for some where the geometry was really screwed up, in which case you actually need to fix it before the other tri appears), there can never exist a tri alone, otherwise it couldnt be fixed, you must always thread a line to the other runaway failed tri
            #Also for starters we could check if the knifing would connect us to another triangle, and if that tri has a similar gradient then it means that we are in a tri-quad-tri strip and those three can be joined into quad-quad by knifing through the middle and dissolving both tri edges
        
    #Alt 10: start on a known good face or face region, use the gradients from that region to expand onto tri affected areas and be able to know how the final topology should look
    #NOTE IMPORTANT: tri on tri merging should only be performed if they're joined not by their short edge, and both their secondary edge gradients are very similar, comparing from the opposite starting point for each edge to the other point on each edge (otherwise we'd end up with isosceles looking quads instead of rectangular ones)
        #Extra (IMPORTANT?): this avoids creating the famous 'diamond' quad, which is actually a very much used and known shape for a quad, but it is extremely uncommon when compared with rectangular quads. Thus I should probably take it into account, but only generate one when there's nothing left to do, aka in the last iteration of the analyser (after having converted everything else that it could)
    #NOTE: bpy.ops.mesh.select_more() #Select More (Ctrl + Numpad +): selects shared faces. Could be useful for quickly finding the non damaged areas of the mesh
    #TODO(fran): I would like to know if there are situations where the indices in the mesh and the ones in bmesh could become disjointed, or when removing verts/edges/faces if that invalidates other indices
    #SUPER IMPORTANT NEW DISCOVERY: the tri-quads-tri strip has an even better property, when in face mode, if pressing Alt on the face to follow the face loop we (almost) always arrive at its brother tri, we can actually simply fix the entire strip in one go. The one thing we need to solve is which side to take, but that can probably be always found out by a combination of attributes (tri strip length, normals, rectangle shapes, and so on)
#INFO SUPER USEFUL: bpy.ops.mesh.vert_connect() (aka vertex connect) is MUCH faster than using the knife tool!
    #INFO: Following with the tri strip idea, a good way to start would be to find the tris closest to the edges of the mesh, though this would only work if the mesh was open, for totally closed meshes we cant find any starting point
    #INFO: there area areas so screwed up that the two tris from the strip dont connect directly along their face loop, because at some point a diamond shape send each one onto opposite directions, in this case, where both tris cant find a match, we would need to find the closest tri-strip match, we can do this because both tris will share the last face before going their separate ways, therefore we'd need to connect both strips through that face

It can also end up generating all quads but in the completely wrong shape (I left another Screenshot with this, it's actually worse than can be seen in the picture because there are overlapping edges), though I think this case will be fixed by itself when we add n-gon generation prevention (following up with this, there seems to be cases stemming from this where strange things start to happen, like verts getting totally misplaced or gone missing)
